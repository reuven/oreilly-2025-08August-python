    "\n",
    "We've talked a number of times about the \"Don't repeat yourself\" rule in programming, aka \"DRY.\" If you have written something once, you shouldn't repeat it!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the same line is repeated several times in a row, we should replace that with a loop.\n",
    "2. If the same code is repeated several times in a program, we should replace that with a function.\n",
    "3. If the same code is repeated several times across multiple programs, we can use a *library*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is a term used in many programming languages to describe either code or data that was defined by someone else, in the past, which you can load into (\"borrow,\" if you will) your program. You don't have to reinvent the wheel this way!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just about every programming language supports libraries. This way, you can save yourself time in the future, or you can save your colleagues time, or they can save you time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if there is a bug in a library, it can be fixed once and affect all of our programs. Or if there's an optimization/fix/improvement, then we can fix it once, and affect all of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we call our libraries \"modules\" and \"packages\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module is a single file in which we've defined Python functions and/or variables\n",
    "- A package is a directory containing one or more modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a module in Python, we get to reuse code and data that other people have defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module also defines what we call a \"namespace,\" a way to ensure that variable names are separated from one another, so different pieces of your program don't step on each other's variables."

    "# AP: What do you mean by \"separate namespaces\" for data and functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have a software product called ABCDE, and I take out a trademark on that product, then no one else in the software industry can have a product called ABCDE, because that would be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if someone comes out with a car and calls it ABCDE, then I cannot stop them from having that trademark, because it's a different field.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could say that even though the name is the same, it's in two different \"namespaces,\" it has two different domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: My name is \"Reuven,\" and there are other Reuvens around. How do we distinguish between me and the others? We use last names! Last names serve as a \"namespace,\" ensuring that I am easily distinguished from other Reuvens out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of namespacing is basically that we need to resolve the ambiguity when there are multiple thigns with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many languages, the namespace for functions and the namespace for variables is kept separate. You can have variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and these names have nothing whatsoever to do with the functions called `a`, `b`, and `c`. They will never interfere with one another. (Whether this is a good idea for you to do in your program is separate.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't make this distinction. In Python, we have a single namespace, a single last name, a single domain for trademarks, for all of the things we define, both functions and variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you define a variable `print`, you have just erased (in some ways) the builtin function `print`.   Only one can exist at a time! (This isn't quite true in the case of `print` and other builtin functions, but it will feel that way if you make such a definition!)\n",
    "- If you define a function `total` that takes a bunch of numbers and returns their total, and then you invoke the function and assign the result to a variable named `total`, you have now erased the function's definition! Because now `total` is an integer, not a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, this means that you have to be a bit careful about what names you give to variables and functions, to ensure that they don't collide in this sort of way.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `def` to define a function, we're really assigning to a variable. "

    "2. The name to its right, unlike *most* programming languages I've used in the last, is not a string indicating the filename that we want to import or read. Rather, it's the name of the variable into which the module's values will be assigned.\n",
